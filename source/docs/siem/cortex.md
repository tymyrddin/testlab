[Cortex](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex) claims: "The SOC is ripe for transformation. Enter Cortex Â® XSIAM, the first AI-powered, automation-first SOC platform that dramatically changes how security teams leverage data and analytics to detect and respond to threats. With Cortex XSIAM, you get dramatically better security and turbocharged SOC performance at half the cost of traditional, outdated approaches."
