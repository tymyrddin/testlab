# Introduction

## What?

Developing our own programs to do analysis.

## Why?

For example, if the program under analysis contains a decryption algorithm, we can develop a separate program that can run the same algorithm that may be used for similar programs with the same decryption algorithm. If we want to identify variants of the file we are analyzing, we could automate the identification for incoming files.

## How?

* [Python](python.md)
* [Yara](yara.md)
* [Visual Studio (Windows)](vs.md)
