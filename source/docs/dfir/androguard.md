# androguard

[Androguard](https://github.com/androguard/androguard) is a tool and python library to interact with Android Files.

Usually they come in the form of Android Packages (APK) or Dalvik Executeable (DEX) files. Androguard has tools to read Androidâ€™s binary format for XML files (AXML) and is also suited with a decompiler for DEX.

Androguard might not only be used as a tool for reverse engineering single applications, but features a lot of functions for automated analysis. It provides a pure python framework to build your own analysis tools.
