# Imaging tools

## Memory acquisition in Linux

On the command-line, use [dd](https://linuxhandbook.com/dd-command/), the data dump tool, and/or [dc3dd](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dc3dd/), the enhancement of `dd`. [Guymager](https://guymager.sourceforge.io/), has built-in case-management abilities and also has many functional similarities to `dc3dd`, but it comes as a GUI tool and may be easier to use.

## Memory acquisition in Windows

On Windows, use [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3-4-3/) (RAM and disk images) or [BelkaImager](https://belkasoft.com/es/bat) (only RAM acquisition).
