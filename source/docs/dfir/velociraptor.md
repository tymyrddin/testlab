# Velociraptor

[Per the documentation](https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/forensic/), _"VQL is not useful without a good set of plugins that make DFIR work possible. Velociraptorâ€™s strength lies in the wide array of VQL plugins and functions that are geared towards making DFIR investigations and detections effective"._

At the date of the entry of this content, the categories surrounding forensic analysis are:

* Searching Filenames
* Searching Content
* NTFS Analysis
* Binary Parsing
* Evidence of Execution
* Event Logs
* Volatile Machine State

Have a skim through `Searching Filenames` and `NTFS Analysis` to provide a solid brain dump.
