# macOS enumeration

## swiftbelt

[SwiftBelt](https://github.com/cedowens/SwiftBelt) is a macOS enumerator inspired by @harmjoy's Windows-based Seatbelt enumeration tool. SwiftBelt does not use any command line utilities and instead uses Swift code (leveraging the Cocoa Framework, Foundation libraries, OSAKit libraries, etc.) to perform system enumeration. This can be leveraged on the offensive side to perform enumeration once you gain access to a macOS host.
