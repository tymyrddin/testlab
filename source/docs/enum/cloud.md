# Cloud enumeration

[CloudBrute](https://github.com/0xsha/CloudBrute) is an enumeration tool for cloud environments. It supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Vultr, Alibaba, and Linode providers) and can identify buckets, applications, files, and storage based on domain information or other target keys supplied at runtime from an unauthenticated perspective. It can also help enumerate exposed ports and HTTP/S services based on what it finds.
