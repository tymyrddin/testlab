# PhishTool

A tool that will help with automated phishing analysis is [PhishTool](https://www.phishtool.com/), and there is a 
free community edition you can download and use. 

PhishTool grabs all the useful information we'll need regarding the email.

* Email sender
* Email recipient (in this case, a long list of CCed email addresses)
* Timestamp
* Originating IP and Reverse DNS lookup

We can obtain information about the SMTP relays, specific X-header information, and IP info information.
