# Malware sandboxes

There are online tools and services where malicious files can be uploaded and analyzed to better understand what the 
malware was programmed to do.

Upload an attachment obtained from a potentially malicious email and see what URLs it attempts to communicate with, 
what additional payloads are downloaded to the endpoint, persistence mechanisms, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), etc.
