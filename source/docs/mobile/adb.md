# Android Debug Bridge (ADB)

The [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) is a command-line utility included with [Googleâ€™s Android SDK](android-sdk.md) for debugging Android-based devices. 

`adb` can control a device over USB from a computer, copy files back and forth, install and uninstall apps, run shell commands, etc. It is part of the [SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

The daemon on the Android device communicates with the server on the host PC through USB or TCP, which communicates with the end-client users via TCP.

5. Push the file back.
6. Put SYSTEM back to READ_ONLY:
