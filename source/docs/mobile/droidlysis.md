# droidlysis

[DroidLysis](https://github.com/cryptax/droidlysis) is a pre-analysis tool for Android apps: it performs repetitive and boring tasks we'd typically do at the beginning of any reverse engineering. It disassembles the Android sample, organizes output in directories, and searches for suspicious spots in the code to look at. The output helps the reverse engineer speed up the first few steps of analysis.

DroidLysis can be used over Android packages (apk), Dalvik executables (dex), Zip files (zip), Rar files (rar) or directories of files.
