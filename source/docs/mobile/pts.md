# PiRogue tool suite

[PiRogue tool suite (PTS)](https://pts-project.org/) is an open-source tool suite that provides a platform combining analysis tools, knowledge management, incident response management and artifact management. It targets Android and iOS, and internet of things (IoT) devices (connected to the user mobile apps), and in general any device using wi-fi to connect to the Internet.

The PTS suite allows NGOs with limited resources to equip themselves at a low cost. It requires a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a hat, a casing, an SD card, and an internet connection. On it!
