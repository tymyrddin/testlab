# Introduction

## What?

Look at the low-level code of a program compiled from a high-level language, or of the same low-level language.

## Why?

Deadlisting and recognising the blocks of code help to build up the behaviour of the program, making it easier to identify only code blocks that need to be thoroughly debugged, without running through the whole program code.
