# Cain

[Cain](https://web.archive.org/web/20190603235413/http://www.oxid.it/cain.html) is the cracking component of the Cain & Abel tool, originally created as a GUI application for Windows 2000 and earlier. It can crack passwords using brute force and dictionary attacks, and supports rainbow tables. 

Password targets include WEP, NTLM and LM hashes, NTLMv2 hashes, MD5 hashes, SHA-1 and SHA-2 hashes, Cisco IOS and PIX hashes, and RADIUS and IKE PSK hashes. The tool is recognised as malware by most host security products. It is only useful when other crackers do not support the hash type or when rainbow tables would be faster than GPU-based attacks using dictionaries or rules-based brute force. Another tool that implements rainbow tables is RainbowCrack.
