# OWASP Honeypot project

The goal of the [OWASP Honeypot Project](https://github.com/OWASP/Honeypot-Project) is to identify emerging attacks against web applications and report them to the community, in order to facilitate protection against such targeted attacks. It uses [ELK stack](../siem/elk-stack.md) and [MISP](../siem/misp.md).
