# Thug

The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past few years shifting focus on poorly protected vulnerable clients. Just as the most known honeypot technologies enable research into server-side attacks, honeyclients allow the study of client-side attacks.

[Thug](https://github.com/buffer/thug) is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicking the behaviour of a web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.

Eager to try this one out, as it seems useful for home contexts.
