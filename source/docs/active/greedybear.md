# GreedyBear

GreedyBear is a Threat Intelligence Platform created to collect, organize and manage data from a cluster of honeypots ([T-Pot](tpot.md)).

The project goal is to extract data of the attacks detected by a TPOT or a cluster of them and to generate some feeds that can be used to prevent and detect attacks.

Documentation about GreedyBear installation, usage, configuration and contribution can be found at [GreedyBear ReadTheDocs](https://greedybear.readthedocs.io/).
