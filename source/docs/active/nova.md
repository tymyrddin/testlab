# Nova

The [Network Obfuscation and Virtualized Anti-Reconnaissance (Nova) System](https://projectnova.org/about/how_it_works/index.html) is an open-source software tool that detects network based reconnaissance efforts - denying the attacker access to real network data while providing false information regarding the number and types of systems connected to the network.

I have not tried it out yet.
