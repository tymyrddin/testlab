# Linux escalation tools

* [PEASS-ng](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) is a script that searches for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux/Unix* hosts. It also enumerates the system.
* [Linux Exploit Suggester 2](https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2) returns a list of possible CVEs, exploits, and exploit POCs (Proof of Concept) for the running Linux kernel.
* [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) is a curated list of Unix binaries that can used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.
* [Traitor](https://github.com/liamg/traitor) takes advantage of local misconfigurations and vulnerabilities (including most of GTFOBins) in order to pop a root shell. These are primarily misconfigurations, not exploits.
