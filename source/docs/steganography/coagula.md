# Coagula

[Coagula](https://www.abc.se/~re/Coagula/Coagula.html) turns images into sounds. Useful for concealing data within sound files (data exfiltration), by bypassing data loss prevention tools or other security controls. Files can be reassembled from the sound file using a tool such as Audacity, Spek, or Sonic Visualiser.
