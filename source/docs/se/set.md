# The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

[The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit) is an open-source Python toolkit for pentesting using social engineering. It has integrations with Ettercap, Metasploit, and other tools.

SET offers custom attack vectors that enable one to set up a believable attack in no time, and includes a website tool that converts a Kali machine into a web server with a range of exploits that can compromise most browsers. The idea is to send a target a link that routes them through the site, which automatically downloads and executes the exploit on their system.

There are pre-built templates in SET to clone a legitimate website so that the exploit looks more realistic. SET has pre-formatted phishing pages of popular sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo. 

Open SET in Kali Linux: **Applications >- KaliLinux -> Exploitation Tools -> Social Engineering Toolkit**, or by entering `setoolkit` on the command-line.
