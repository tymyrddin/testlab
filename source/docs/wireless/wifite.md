# Wifite

[Wifite](https://github.com/derv82/wifite2) is a Python script for attacking wireless networks. It can perform the offline pixie dust attacks and online PIN brute-forcing against WPS networks; capture WPA handshakes and PMKID hashes; and perform various WEP attacks, including fragmentation, chopchop, and replay attacks. 

It requires the [aircrack-ng suite](aircrack-ng.md) for wireless capture, relay, and cracking.
