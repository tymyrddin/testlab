[Fern](http://www.fern-pro.com/) is a Python tool for Wi-Fi security auditing and cracking. It can recover WEP, WPA, and WPS keys, and can be used for several types of Wi-Fi attacks (Reaver, chopchop, fragmentation attacks, etc.). It comes in a [free version onGitHub](https://github.com/savio-code/fern-wifi-cracker) and a paid professional version. It requires the [aircrack-ng suite](aircrack-ng.md), Scapy, and [Reaver](reaver.md).
