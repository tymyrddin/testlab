# OAST alternatives

Only BurpSuite Professional has the collaborator, and costs a lot. ZAP does not include OAST functionality. And there are alternatives:

* [pingb.in](http://pingb.in) was originally for capturing ICMP pings with a unique payload, it works great for DNS and HTTP too. It does not seem to support HTTPS though.
* The [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) supports inspecting, testing and automating (with the visual Custom Actions builder, or WebhookScript) incoming HTTP request sor e-mail.
* [transfer.bi.tk/](https://transfer.bi.tk/)
* [canary tokens](https://www.canarytokens.org/generate)
* [Interactsh](https://github.com%2Fprojectdiscovery%2Finteractsh) is an open-source tool for detecting out-of-band interactions. It is a tool designed to detect vulnerabilities that cause external interactions. Also see [app.interactsh.com](https://app.interactsh.com).
