# Create recon scripts

* [Recon scripts](https://github.com/tymyrddin/scripts-webapp/tree/main/recon) contains some home-baked scripts.
* [Oralyzer](https://github.com/r0075h3ll/Oralyzer) is a simple python script that probes for Open Redirection vulnerability in a website. It does that by fuzzing the URL that is provided in the input.
