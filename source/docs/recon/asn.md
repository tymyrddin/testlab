# Finding ASN numbers

An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique number assigned to an autonomous system (AS) by the Internet Assigned 
Numbers Authority (IANA). An AS consists of blocks of IP addresses which have a distinctly defined policy for 
accessing external networks and are administered by a single organisation but may be made up of several operators.

Find the IP ranges of an organisation using [ASN Lookup](https://asnlookup.com/).
