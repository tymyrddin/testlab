# Researching certificates

ðŸ‘‰ Wildcard certificates are a single point of failure. If we stumble upon the private key while roaming the network, we could intercept the communication flow of ***all*** applications using that same parent domain.

When a certificate authority issues a certificate, these are entered into a central repository called a certificate log. This repository keeps a binary tree of all certificates, where each node is the hash of its child nodes, thereby guaranteeing the integrity of the entire chain. All issued TLS certificates should be publicly published to detect domain spoofing, typo-squatting, homograph attacks, and other mischievous ways to deceive and redirect users. These logs can be searched.

Secret applications with little security hiding behind proxies can be exposed, and minimally subdomain enumeration is way faster.

## Tools

* [Censys](https://censys.io/) ([search censys](https://search.censys.io/)) scans publicly exposed certificate assets on the Internet and stores the details in a searchable database. Useful during passive reconnaissance for gathering ports and services listening on hosts and other data about a target.
