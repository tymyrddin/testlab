# Custom Word List Generator (CeWL)

[Custom Word List Generator (CeWL)](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) will crawl target websites and assemble a wordlist using interesting terms identified during the crawl, including e-mail addresses. These wordlists can then be used for further targeting, brute-forcing possible URLs, hostnames, or even as password cracking dictionaries. CeWL is a command line tool with options for controlling the depth of the crawl, output file, user agent to send, length of words that it collects, and including e-mail addresses.
