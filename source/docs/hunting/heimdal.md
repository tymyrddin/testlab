# Heimdal Threat-hunting and Action Center

The Heimdal Threat-hunting and Action Center is a ground-breaking platform that works in tandem with the Heimdal solution suite.

It uses built-in hunting, remediation, and actioning capabilities to provide an advanced threat-centric view of the IT landscape.

In addition, the Threat-hunting and Action Center uses the industry-standard MITRE ATT&CK techniques to assist in proactively classifying and prioritising security risks, hunting anomalies, and neutralising threats in a secure environment.
