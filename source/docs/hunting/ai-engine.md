# AIEngine

AIEngine is an example of a situational awareness-driven tool. It is an interactive tool that can update a network's intrusion detection system. It inspects Python, Ruby, Java, and Lua packets, and includes next-generation interactive/programmable NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) functionality, DNS domain classification, network collector, network forensics, and many other features.

It can be used to detect spam and collect networks without needing human interaction for learning and network forensics.
