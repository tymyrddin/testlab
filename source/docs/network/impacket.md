# Impacket

[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a Python tool suite used for network protocol manipulation.

[mitm6](https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6) intercepts DNS and DHCP queries from a selected target and operates as a rogue DNS/DHCP server. This can then be used to redirect victim traffic to other malicious resources or perform relay attacks when used with tools like ntlmrelayx in Impacket.
