# Responder

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) is a tool for responding to LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS requests and intercepting the resulting data from that exchange.

It can be used to gather Windows challenge hashes resulting from requests to nonexistent services or other maliciously redirected requests.
