# Ettercap

[Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) is an on-path tool for network traffic. It can be used for ARP spoofing attacks, sniffing network traffic over a live connection, and applying filters to modify that traffic in real time. 

Useful when having access to a network and needing to intercept or modify traffic between other network endpoints on the same subnet in order to further access.
