# MSOLSpray

[MSOLSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray) is a password spraying tool for Microsoft Online accounts (Azure/O365). The script logs if a user credential is valid, if MFA is enabled on the account, if a tenant doesn't exist, if a user doesn't exist, if the account is locked, or if the account is disabled.

**BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LOCKOUT ACCOUNTS!**
