# SOC Prime

[SOC Prime](https://socprime.com/) is a marketplace of Sigma rules for the latest and greatest exploits and vulnerabilities.

The company pays security researchers a bounty every time their content is used, and allows subscribers to rate the content to determine how big a payout they get.

They are also the makers of tools like [Uncoder](https://uncoder.io/), to convert one standard Sigma rule into a range of other search syntax languages, and [Uncoder AI](https://my.socprime.com/uncoder-ai/), an augmented intelligence framework powered by collective industry expertise and backed by Sigma and MITRE ATT&CKÂ® as code assistants.
